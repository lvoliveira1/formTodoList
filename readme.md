On this repo you can find three files:
    1 - index.html
    2 - planner.jsx
    3 - styles.css
On the first file (index.html) it is used to bring into action both the CSS file and the JSX file.
The JSX file is where you find the whole logic of the app. There are some comments explaining what each part of the app does.
The CSS file creates the logic for adding styles to the list.
